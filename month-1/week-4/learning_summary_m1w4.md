# Week 4 – Learning Summary  
## Skybrisks Data Science Internship

### 📘 Topics Learned
In Week 4, I learned how to visualize data using two key libraries:

### **Matplotlib**
- Creating line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms  
- Adding titles, axis labels, and customizing visuals  
- Understanding how plots reveal patterns in data  

### **Seaborn**
- Advanced visualization library built on Matplotlib  
- Used for pairplots, heatmaps, boxplots, distribution plots  
- Helps analyze relationships and correlations between features  

These visualization tools are essential for exploring datasets and presenting insights.

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I completed several exercises including:

- Creating line plots and scatter plots  
- Drawing histograms to view distributions  
- Using pairplots to visualize multi-feature relationships  
- Creating heatmaps to study correlations  

These tasks strengthened my ability to interpret data visually.

### 🎯 Client Project: Visualization Dashboard
For the Week-4 client project, I created a **mini visualization dashboard** consisting of:

- Scatter plot (total bill vs tip)  
- Histogram (bill distribution)  
- Box plot (tip variability)  

This dashboard helps analyze numeric relationships and distributions in the dataset.
