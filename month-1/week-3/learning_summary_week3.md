# Week 3 – Learning Summary
## Skybrisks Data Science Internship

### 📘 Topics Learned
Week 3 introduced two essential data-science libraries:

### **NumPy**
- Creating arrays and performing mathematical operations
- Broadcasting (applying operations across arrays automatically)
- Reshaping arrays
- Efficient numeric computation

### **Pandas**
- Working with Series and DataFrames
- Indexing, filtering, and selecting data
- Handling missing values using `dropna()` and `fillna()`
- Removing duplicates with `drop_duplicates()`
- Grouping and aggregating data using `groupby()`
- Descriptive statistics (`mean()`, `describe()`)

These tools form the foundation of modern data manipulation in Python.

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I performed several practical exercises including:
- Array arithmetic and transformations using NumPy  
- Creating and modifying DataFrames  
- Filtering rows based on conditions  
- Handling missing values  
- Summary statistics and data inspection  

These tasks helped me understand real-world cleaning and analysis workflows.

### 🎯 Client Project: Dataset Cleaning & Aggregation Pipeline
For this week’s client-style project, I built a **data-cleaning pipeline** using only NumPy and Pandas.  
The script:

- Removes duplicates  
- Drops missing values  
- Calculates column-wise means  
- Performs grouping and aggregation  
- Saves the cleaned dataset  

This project simulates the preprocessing step done before any data analysis or machine learning task.

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of Week 3, I gained confidence in manipulating datasets, cleaning data efficiently, and extracting insights using NumPy and Pandas—key skills in data science.
