# Week 1 – Learning Summary  
## Skybrisks Data Science Internship

### 📘 Topics Learned
During Week 1, I learned the foundational elements of Python programming:

- **Variables and Data Types**: integers, floats, strings, booleans  
- **Basic Operators**: arithmetic, comparison, logical operators  
- **Input & Output**: using `input()` and `print()`  
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else` used for decision-making  
- **Loops**:  
  - `for` loops for iterating over a range  
  - `while` loops for repeated execution based on conditions  
- **Basic Program Logic**: combining conditions and loops to solve problems

These concepts created a strong foundation for writing automation scripts and handling structured logic in Python.

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I completed multiple exercises including:

- Temperature conversion program  
- Basic calculator  
- Even-odd checker  
- Multiplication table generator  
- Summation of natural numbers  

These helped me become comfortable with Python syntax and logical flow.

### 🎯 Client Project: Temperature Analyzer
For the week’s client-style project, I built a **Temperature Analyzer** program using only Week-1 concepts.  
The script allows users to input multiple temperature readings and provides:

- Total number of readings  
- Average temperature  
- Highest temperature  
- Lowest temperature  

This project improved my skills in handling user input, loops, conditional logic, and basic computations.

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of Week 1, I gained confidence in:

- Writing small Python scripts  
- Using loops and conditions to automate tasks  
- Handling real user input  
- Structuring programs logically  

This serves as the foundation for data manipulation and analysis in upcoming weeks.
