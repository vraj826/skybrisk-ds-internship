# Week 2 – Learning Summary  
## Skybrisks Data Science Internship

### 📘 Topics Learned
In Week 2, I studied Python data structures and function design.  
Key concepts include:

- **Lists** – ordered, mutable collections  
- **Tuples** – ordered, immutable collections  
- **Sets** – store unique elements  
- **Dictionaries** – key-value pairs  
- **Functions** – reusable blocks of code  
- **Lambda functions** – small anonymous functions  
- **Recursion** – functions calling themselves  
- **List Comprehension** – concise data transformation  

These concepts helped me build efficient and readable programs.

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I practiced:

- Filtering lists using list comprehension  
- Tuple operations like finding max/min  
- Counting word frequency using dictionaries  
- Extracting unique values using sets  
- Writing recursive functions like factorial  

These tasks strengthened my Python logic and data processing abilities.

### 🎯 Client Project: Basic Data Cleaning System
For this week’s project, I created a **data-cleaning system** using only Week-2 concepts.  
The script performs:

- Removal of `None` values  
- Removal of duplicates  
- Filtering numbers based on a threshold  
- Use of list comprehension and functions  

This mimics real preprocessing steps used in data analysis while staying within core Python features.

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of Week 2, I gained stronger control over Python’s built-in data structures, improved my function-writing skills, and learned to create structured cleaning pipelines without external libraries.
