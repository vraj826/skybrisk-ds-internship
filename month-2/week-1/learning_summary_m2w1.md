# Month 2 – Week 1 Learning Summary
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Basics

### 📘 Topics Learned
In this week, I learned the foundational steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
Key concepts include:

- Loading datasets using Pandas
- Viewing dataset structure with `head()`, `info()`, and `shape`
- Computing summary statistics using `describe()`
- Identifying missing values and handling them with `fillna()` and `dropna()`
- Checking correlations between numerical variables
- Creating simple distribution plots for initial visual checks

These techniques help reveal patterns, data quality issues, and underlying relationships.

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I completed exercises that covered:

- Loading CSV files
- Viewing statistics and metadata
- Detecting and fixing missing values
- Computing correlation matrices
- Visualizing basic distributions using Matplotlib

These tasks strengthened my EDA workflow skills.

### 🎯 Client Project: EDA Report Generator
I built an **automated EDA report generator** that:

- Loads a dataset  
- Displays structure, missing-value summary, and descriptive statistics  
- Computes correlation matrix for numeric columns  
- Generates a basic histogram for distribution analysis  

This project simulates the first step of any real-world data science pipeline.

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of Week 1, I developed a solid understanding of how to explore, clean, and summarize datasets—an essential foundation before applying machine learning in future weeks.
