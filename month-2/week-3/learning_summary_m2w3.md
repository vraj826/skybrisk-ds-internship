# Month 2 – Week 3 Learning Summary
## Supervised Learning – Classification (Logistic Regression)

### 📘 Topics Learned
This week focused on classification problems using Logistic Regression.  
Key concepts include:

- Difference between regression and classification
- Binary classification using Logistic Regression
- Predicting class labels and probabilities
- Evaluating classification models using accuracy, precision, and recall
- Understanding confusion matrices

---

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I worked on:

- Training Logistic Regression models
- Making class and probability predictions
- Evaluating classification performance
- Visualizing confusion matrices

---

### 🎯 Client Project: Binary Classification System
I built a classification system that:

- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Predicts class labels on test data
- Evaluates performance using standard classification metrics
