# Month 2 – Week 4 Learning Summary
## Feature Engineering & Model Improvement

### 📘 Topics Learned
In Week 4, I focused on improving machine learning model performance through feature engineering techniques.  
Key concepts include:

- Scaling numerical features using standardization
- Encoding categorical variables for ML models
- Selecting important features
- Using pipelines to streamline preprocessing and modeling
- Evaluating and comparing model performance

---

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I practiced:

- Applying feature scaling
- Encoding categorical data
- Selecting key features
- Comparing model accuracy
- Building basic ML pipelines

---

### 🎯 Client Project: Improved Classification Model
I built an improved classification system that:

- Encodes and scales features
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluates improved accuracy after preprocessing
