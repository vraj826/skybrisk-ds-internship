# Month 2 – Week 2 Learning Summary
## Supervised Learning – Linear Regression

### 📘 Topics Learned
This week focused on the fundamentals of supervised machine learning using linear regression.  
Key concepts include:

- Understanding supervised learning problems
- Splitting datasets into training and testing sets
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Making predictions on unseen data
- Evaluating models using MAE, MSE, and RMSE
- Visualizing regression results

---

### 🧪 Hands-On Practice
I practiced:

- Preparing feature and target variables
- Training regression models using scikit-learn
- Evaluating prediction accuracy
- Visualizing regression lines

---

### 🎯 Client Project: Regression-Based Prediction System
I built a **regression prediction system** that:

- Trains a Linear Regression model
- Evaluates model performance using error metrics
- Predicts target values from input features

This project introduced me to end-to-end supervised ML workflows.

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of Week 2, I gained a strong understanding of supervised learning basics and how regression models are trained, evaluated, and interpreted in real-world scenarios.
